<aibird> > villagers are initially skeptical, but after seeing how much easier their lives are with Linux, they're soon converted 
<aibird> > I'm hailed as a hero, and the villagers throw a big party in my honor 
<aibird> > at the party, I'm introduced to the chief's daughter, a beautiful young woman named Kuma 
<aibird> > we hit it off immediately, and before I know it, we're making love under the stars 
<aibird> > Kuma is wild in bed, and I soon discover that she's into some pretty kinky stuff 
<aibird> > we spend the night exploring each other's bodies, and I quickly fall head-over-heels in love with her 
<aibird> > the next morning, I wake up to find Kuma gone 
<aibird> > I search for her all day, but she's nowhere to be found 
<aibird> > eventually, I go to the chief and ask him what happened to her 
<aibird> > he tells me that she was taken by a lion while she was out gathering firewood 
<aibird> > I'm devastated, but the chief says that it's the way of things
